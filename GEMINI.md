# Gemini Project: Ignition View Generator (IVG)

This document provides a guide for interacting with the `Ignition View Generator` project using Gemini.

## Project Overview

The Ignition View Generator (IVG) is a developer tool that transforms YAML into Ignition Perspective Views. It allows you to define views, components, and layouts using a clean, human-readable YAML syntax, which is then compiled into valid `view.json` resources ready for the Ignition Gateway.

## How to Use

To get started, you can ask Gemini to perform the following tasks:

*   **List files:** "List the files in the `4_ignition-view-generator` directory."
*   **Read a file:** "Read the contents of the `generator.py` file."
*   **Summarize the project:** "Summarize the Ignition View Generator project."
*   **Explain how to use the generator:** "How do I use the `generator.py` script?"

*This document is intended for use with the Gemini CLI.*
